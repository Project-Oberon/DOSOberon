OBERON FOR MS-DOS
This file contains all the changes made for the current release.

5. 1. 93
 Bug with Date fixed

9. 12. 92
 Release V1.4
	
 Write V2.4:
 - Write frames can be nested.
 - Scrolling backwards implemented (right mouse key in scroll bar).
 - Scrolling to end of text (middle-left) shows the end of the text at 
   the bottom of the frame.
 - Right margin
 of a paragraph can be set with Write.Set right 
   (number | "default") directly.
 - Setting the left margin with Write.Set left does not change the right 
   margin, but the width of the paragraph is adjusted. This corresponds with 
   the interactive setting of the left margin.
 - Write.Open and Write.SysOpen accept strings to specify filenames that 
   do not follow the Oberon naming convention.
 - The Tick in the scroll bar is two pixels high. This helps in 
   discriminating between Text frame
s and Write frames.
 - WriteTools.ToASCII removes all kinds of diacritical marks.
 - Write.Guide.Text updated.
 - Write.Programming.Text: minor bug eliminated.
