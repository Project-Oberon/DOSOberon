Introduction

Oberon is both a programming language and an operating environment. It 
is the final outcome of a research project whose aim was an extensible, 
highly integrated and compact operating platform for single-user personal 
workstations.

The original project was launched and carried out by N. Wirth and 
J. Gutknecht for the Ceres workstation. Now, ported versions of the 
Oberon language and system are available for numerous commercial machines, 
among them MacIntosh, IBM RS/6000, DEC station, SPARC station and 
IBM PC/386 compatibles.

Literature

The following is a family of books on Oberon. 
It is available from Addison-Wesley company:

	The Oberon System- User Guide and Programmer's Manual,
		by M. Reiser

	Programming in Oberon- Steps beyond Modula-2,
		by M. Reiser and N. Wirth

	Project Oberon- The Design of an Operating System
		and Compiler, by N. Wirth and J. Gutknecht

MS-DOS Oberon

Oberon for IBM PC/386 compatibles is called MS-DOS Oberon. Even though 
MS-DOS Oberon is highly congruent with the original system as described 
in the above listed literature, there are some preconditions and 
implementation specialties to know. The following sections summarize 
these points. They also include a summary of principles of operation 
and an installation guide.

Hardware Requirements

	1) Intel 80386DX- or 80386SX-processor
	2) 2 megabytes or more of main memory
	3) mouse with 2 or 3 buttons and driver
	4) VGA-board

Additionally, if REAL arithmetic is used

	5) Intel 80387DX- or 80387SX-Coprocessor

Software Requirements

	1) DOS version 3.3 or 5.0 
	2) HIMEM.SYS driver for extended memory access

Principles of Operation and Installation Guide

Mode of Operation

MS-DOS Oberon principally operates in 386 protected mode in high memory 
above 1 MB. Below the 1 MB limit are video-RAM, extender, system loader, 
Oberon kernel and the procedure activation stack. The extender handles 
interrupts and DOS system calls. It also bootstraps the Oberon module 
loader and starts the Oberon system.

Restriction

No other software running in protected mode or V86 mode must be installed 
simultaneously with Oberon. This restriction applies in particular to 
SMARTDRIVE and expanded memory managers like EMM386.

File System

MS-DOS Oberon maintains a special DOS file directory called OBERON. It 
contains all Oberon files that are created at Oberon run-time. Note that 
Oberon file names may be up to 31 characters long and may contain an 
arbitrary number of part-separators ".". Oberon translates such file 
names internally into aliasing DOS file names and maintains a translation 
table.

In addition, Oberon offers commands System.CopyFromDOS and System.CopyToDOS, 
allowing file copy from arbitrary DOS directories to Oberon and vice versa.
Example:  System.CopyFromDOS a:/MyDir/Filename.Ext => Oberonname~

Diskettes

Data transfer from and to diskettes is supported by module Backup. Data 
on Oberon diskettes are stored in a private format that supports full 
Oberon file names. Use commands SetDriveA and SetDriveB to set the 
current drive.

Keyboard

The following table shows how to generate special characters under Oberon 
control.

special character  key

mark viewer        F1
no scroll          F2
line feed          F3
double s           shift-F3
break              F4
shift-break        shift-F4
escape             ESC

ae                  ctrl-a
oe                  ctrl-o
ue                  ctrl-u
Ae                  shift-F8
Oe                  shift-F9
Ue                  shift-F10

Mouse

The standard Oberon user interface is based on a 3-button mouse and on 
the following interpretation of button clicks:

Primary clicks:

    left: set caret
    middle: execute
    right: select

Interclicks while selecting (holding down the right button):

   left: delete selected data 
   middle: copy selected data to caret
   left & middle: undo

Alternatively, interclicking left/middle can be replaced by pressing 
ctrl-key/alt-key on the keyboard.

MS-DOS Oberon also supports a 2-button mouse. In this case, the left 
button subsumes the functions execute and set caret. To switch from 
execute to set caret, keep the mouse still and the button pressed for 
ca. 0.5 sec.

Printing
 
DOS-Oberon uses the Postscript language as a common interface to printing 
devices. If a laser printer is connected to one of the serial ports COM1 
or COM2 via 9600 baud, the postscript code is automatically sent to this 
printer, otherwise it is stored under the name "Oberon.Printfile.ps" on 
the local disk.
Example: Edit.Print COM1 filename~

System Installation and Operation

The installation kit consists of the following files:

	name           contents

	README.TXT     this description
	SYSTEM.EXE     Oberon system in compressed form (selfextracting file)
	or
	SYSTEM.LZH     Oberon system in compressed form (LHA kit necessary)

to install Oberon

	1) assert FILES = 64 in CONFIG.SYS
	2) create directory OBERON
	3) copy SYSTEM.EXE or SYSTEM.LZH into directory OBERON
	4) execute SYSTEM.EXE or unpack SYSTEM.LZH

to load and start Oberon

	5) install mouse driver
	6) set current directory to OBERON
	7) execute START command

System Exit

	8) Activate command System.Quit

Note:
The OBERON directory is considered to be private to Oberon.
In particular, all files that are not accessible from Oberon are deleted 
at startup time!

Getting started with Oberon

The above mentioned book The Oberon System- User Guide and Programmer's 
Manual is a complete and comprehensive guide to the basic Oberon system. 
In addition, online documentation for the Write system and the Draw 
system is included in the installation kit, as well as some sample source 
code files. See Write.Tool, Draw.Tool, Paint.Tool and System.Tool for 
prepared opening commands.
